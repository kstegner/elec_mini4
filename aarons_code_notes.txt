ISR = interrpt service routine
--can't accept or return values

void __attribute__((interrupt, auto_psv)) _T1Interrupt(void)

You can find the name of the interrupt term in the .gld file

Interrupts have priority from 0 (none) to 7 (most), default is 4
IVT = interrupt vector table tells you the order to interrupt priorities

to disable the interrupt

__builtin_disi(number of cycles to executre, max is 16,383)
char saved_ipl;
SET_AND_SAVE_CPU_IPL (saved_ipl, 7)
...
RESTORE_CPU_IPL(saved_ipl);

REMEMBER: always clear the interrupt flag
_T1IF = 0;
you can find this term in the header file for the PIC

We might want to use this by incrementing a "tick value" that measures the movement of the encoder across the "detect change" pins
Or to measure the back EMF of the motor as we drive it forwards - measure the falling-edge of the PWM
